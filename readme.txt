Yes (for now)! We're just getting started designing a full-fledged design framework with patterns that can be composed to build any design, directly within the Gutenberg block editor. This is just the start!

Indeed! We're ramping up block development with custom blocks to include in our Tile library, starting with our very own [progress bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tiles-progress-block/) and creatively unique [marquee](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tiles-marquee-block/) block.
